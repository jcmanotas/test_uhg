Design a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
----------------------------------------

* An LRU cache is temporary storage for objects.
* An object is a key-value pair (String key, Object value).
* The cache can contain max_size elements.
* When you try to add an element, if the cache is full, you should remove the LEAST-recently used object to make room.
* Objects are "used" when they are added or read.
* When an object is used, it becomes the MOST recently used.

 

=====================================
The two methods you should implement:

1. def add_object(String key, Object object)
2. def get_object(String key)
